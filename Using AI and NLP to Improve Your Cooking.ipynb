Like I stated, I used a ladle to form: 4 slices bacon, then one x-thinly sliced chicken breast/diced al dente veggies (broccoli, carrot, celery, onion,) slice provolone, the jalapenos, sea salt n' pepper. After filling, I WRAPPED the bacon slices over the filling till it looked like a little woven package.  Baked at 375, broil 4 minutes. ( I crisped up bottom in a skillet for a few minutes.) I sliced w/ tomato and shredded mozzarella. I'm going to try the cream cheese next time! \",\n",

And stuffing the pepper halves seems to help keep the yummy gooey cheese mix inside the chicken. I didnt use bacon, as I think two different type of cheese is enough calorie loaded ingredients for one meal. It was still amazing! Next time I am thinking of doing just Cream Cheese and using a turkey bacon. Would that type of bacon work? I feel that with the lower fat content it might crisp better than regular bacon? ',\n",

       " \" I just want to add a note here... using fresh jalapenos is great, but they taste much better if you roast them first!  Roasting really brings out the depth of flavor that you need with chicken and cheese.  Roasting is easy... just broil the peppers (after halving and seeding) skin side up until the skin starts to blacken and bubble.  Then pop them into a ziplock bag or sealed container to steam for at least 20 minutes.  When they're done, the peppers are nice and soft (and smell wonderful) and the skins just slip right off!   Give the recipe a try this way.  I think you'll really love it!   \",\n",
